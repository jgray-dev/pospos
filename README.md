## Goals:
- Create a full restaurant management system.
- Wait staff should be able to input orders that go directly to the grill (receipt printer) that get re-organized automatically for readability and efficiency on the grill.
- Grill order's should be automatically "grouped" on time intervals, and list the items in "length" order (hard-boiled, drop, frt, burgers, toast, salads, sides, etc...)
- Adding new employee's should be as easy as invite links with specific roles already assigned. Admins can create these links and specify the roles to be given automatically. When the employee clicks the link, they either create an account with some additional params to give them that level auth, or they log in and are given those additional auths
- Favorite foods/US foods list should be remarkable easy. Digital lists that can be modified by the admins. Very easy to input, select a number (with presets) and a unit (cs or ea) and move on. Maybe even some AI integration and camera detection???? <- camera stuff would be more well suited to daily prep
- Daily prep should also be painless and remarkably easy. Prep enters the list digitally, and it either automatically gives us the things to do/par #'s, or it's sent to the prep manager for manual inputting.
